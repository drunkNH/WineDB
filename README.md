# WineDB
## Program Description
- The purpose of this program is to learn about using databases, more specifically the MySQL database service. Databases are applicable for many situations that involve storing and retrieving data, such as a database of cars, food, and employees at a company, keeping information organized and being very accessible. MySQL is used specifically as it’s a free open source database service that can handle larger databases with optimal performance. In this program, the user will have a menu of choices that’ll allow the user to display all wine within a certain score range in the database based on user inputs, display all wine within a certain price range in the database based on user inputs, display the top 10 wines in the database in terms of price starting from highest price to lowest, being able to insert a completely new wine in the database based on user input, and being able to update an existing wine’s price in the database based on the name of the wine chosen. User inputs will be validated to ensure that the user does not input an invalid input e.g. inputting -56 as a price or “five hundred” as a score. 
- This program was made in the Fall of 2020, in the course CS116 taught by Ron Sha, who provided dbconnect.cpp and dbconnect.h, as well as sample code in winedb.cpp that I built off of.
## Utilization
Type "make" in terminal of the directory the program is in, then type "./winedb" to run the program.
